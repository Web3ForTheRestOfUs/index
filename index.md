# Learning and Building in the Crypto Space

## Difference Between Fact and Truth
- **Fact**: Something indisputable, based on empirical evidence, proven through calculation or past events.
- **Truth**: May include facts, but can also be influenced by beliefs and perceptions.

### Key Facts for Our Project Goals
1. **Solana** has more funding, investments, and grant opportunities.
2. Solana has a better infrastructure than Ethereum in some aspects, though itâ€™s still evolving.
3. Solana is relatively new, providing room to establish ourselves in the space quickly.

### Plan of Action
- **Goal**: Build projects to learn and enhance our credibility in the crypto space.
- **Approach**: Every two weeks, choose a project idea from a curated list and develop it. This results in around two projects per month.
- **Language of Choice**: **Rust**. This versatile language expands beyond blockchain to server and systems programming, making it a valuable skill.

## The Daily Standup
A structured 1-hour session divided into:
- **Learn**: Review new concepts and resources.
- **Understand**: Discuss current tasks and objectives.
